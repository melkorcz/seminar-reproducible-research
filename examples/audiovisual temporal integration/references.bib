abstract = {Theoretical developments have proceeded relatively independently in the human and animal timing literatures, even though many of the issues addressed have been similar. In the animal timing literature, an influential model is Scalar Timing. There have been few direct applications of Scalar Timing to human timing. The main purpose of the present paper is to present human timing data from experiments designed specifically to evaluate Scalar Timing. A human analog of the animal bisection discrimination procedure was used. The human bisection data were consonant with Scalar Timing: bisection was at the GM of the two referent durations and psychometric functions superposed when normalized by the bisection point.},

@article{Alvarez2011,
abstract = {The visual system can only accurately represent a handful of objects at once. How do we cope with this severe capacity limitation? One possibility is to use selective attention to process only the most relevant incoming information. A complementary strategy is to represent sets of objects as a group or ensemble (e.g. represent the average size of items). Recent studies have established that the visual system computes accurate ensemble representations across a variety of feature domains and current research aims to determine how these representations are computed, why they are computed and where they are coded in the brain. Ensemble representations enhance visual cognition in many ways, making ensemble coding a crucial mechanism for coping with the limitations on visual processing.},

@article{Chong2005,
abstract = {This paper explores some structural constraints on computing the mean sizes of sets of elements. Neither number nor density had much effect on judgments of mean size. Intermingled sets of circles segregated only by color gave mean discrimination thresholds for size that were as accurate as sets segregated by location. They were about the same when the relevant color was cued, when it was not cued, and when no distractor set was present. The results suggest that means are computed automatically and in parallel after an initial preattentive segregation by color.},

@article{Dehaene2008,
abstract = {The mapping of numbers onto space is fundamental to measurement and to mathematics. Is this mapping a cultural invention or a universal intuition shared by all humans regardless of culture and education? We probed number-space mappings in the Mundurucu, an Amazonian indigene group with a reduced numerical lexicon and little or no formal education. At all ages, the Mundurucu mapped symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers onto a logarithmic scale, whereas Western adults used linear mapping with small or symbolic numbers and logarithmic mapping when numbers were presented nonsymbolically under conditions that discouraged counting. This indicates that the mapping of numbers onto space is a universal intuition and that this initial intuition of number is logarithmic. The concept of a linear number line appears to be a cultural invention that fails to develop in the absence of formal education.},

@article{Shi2010a,
abstract = {Research on multisensory interactions has shown that the perceived timing of a visual event can be captured by a temporally proximal sound. This effect has been termed 'temporal ventriloquism effect.' Using the Ternus display, we systematically investigated how auditory configurations modulate the visual apparent-motion percepts. The Ternus display involves a multielement stimulus that can induce either of two different percepts of apparent motion: 'element motion' or 'group motion'. We found that two sounds presented in temporal proximity to, or synchronously with, the two visual frames, respectively, can shift the transitional threshold for visual apparent motion (Experiments 1 and 3). However, such effects were not evident with single-sound configurations (Experiment 2). A further experiment (Experiment 4) provided evidence that time interval information is an important factor for crossmodal interaction of audiovisual Ternus effect. The auditory interval was perceived as longer than the same physical visual interval in the sub-second range. Furthermore, the perceived audiovisual interval could be predicted by optimal integration of the visual and auditory intervals.},

abstract = {Precise timing is crucial to decision-making and behavioral control, yet subjective time can be easily distorted by various temporal contexts. Application of a Bayesian framework to various forms of contextual calibration reveals that, contrary to popular belief, contextual biases in timing help to optimize overall performance under noisy conditions. Here, we review recent progress in understanding these forms of temporal calibration, and integrate a Bayesian framework with information-processing models of timing. We show that the essential components of a Bayesian framework are closely related to the clock, memory, and decision stages used by these models, and that such an integrated framework offers a new perspective on distortions in timing and time perception that are otherwise difficult to explain. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
